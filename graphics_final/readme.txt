Use Mozilla Firefox to play this game.
The game is a simple chasing game, your goal is to "catch" Scarfy, the orange cat who is floating around the scene. To zoom in and out of the scene, use the trackpad or mouse to zoom in/out. You can rotate around a pivot point by left-clicking, holding the mouse and rotating. Right click and hold to pan the camera. To move Kirby, use the following controls:

W to move forward
A to move left
S to move backwards
D to move right
I to move up
K to move down

DO NOT USE the up - right - left - down keys, as these control the camera as part of the OrbitControls.js script. To control the camera, just use the trackpad/mouse!
